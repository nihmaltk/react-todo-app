A simple and clean Todo List built with **React**. This project focuses on mastering React fundamentals such as state management, props, conditional rendering, component composition, event handling, and data persistence using `localStorage`.

## Features

- Delete tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Filter tasks by **All**, **Open**, or **Completed**  
- Persistent storage using **localStorage** 
- Responsive design (basic layout)
- Clean, minimal styling (focus on logic, not UI)

## Technologies Used

- **CSS3**
- **Font Awesome** (for icons)

## Live Demo

## Data Persistence

This app uses **localStorage** along with the `useEffect` hook to persist tasks across browser reloads. Your tasks are saved automatically every time you add, complete, or delete a task.

## Note

This project is designed as a **learning project**, focusing more on understanding React fundamentals and less on pixel-perfect UI. It serves as a foundational step in building more complex applications.
